### Obsidian Tooling In Go

This is a project that I'm using to learn Go, and to automate the tedious things I don't want to do manually in Go.

It automatically backs up my notes to GitHub so I don't lose them, and can clear completed tasks throughout the entire vault using a recursive function.

I would encourage anyone that uses Obsidian to look into this code! I think everyone can benefit from the functionality it has even at this primitive stage.
